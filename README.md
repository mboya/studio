# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

This application has been configured as a Progressive Web App. To complete the PWA setup:

1.  Create an `icons` directory in the `public` folder (`public/icons`).
2.  Add the following icon files to the `public/icons` directory (or update `public/manifest.json` with your icon paths):
    *   `icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
    *   `icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

These icons will be used when users add the app to their home screen.
